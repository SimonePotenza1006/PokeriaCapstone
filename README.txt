Hello world!
I would like to introduce 'Itachi Pokeria', my first web application that includes both front-end and back-end design.
How often do entrepreneurs in small-town catering find themselves unable to use the deliveroo service of large, popular companies such as JustEat and Glovo? It's a pretty well-known reality, and that's why when they want to offer a home delivery service they have to deal with classic phone calls to take the order and then get a cash on delivery.
With my web application, however, I created with an attractive style the website of this Pokeria that allows the user, through a registration, to be able to comfortably order their Poke Bowl from home and without waiting on their mobile phone through an attractive UI and UX using JavaScript, also proceeding with the mode of payment through a bank circuit; also through a Login procedure, the site admins will be able to have a full management of the business, thanks to functions that can only be used by the administrators that allow them to modify the list of available ingredients with their additional prices, or modify the Poke included in the menu, create new ones and monitor all the orders that are made by the users!
To test my application just download my GitHub, you will find a back-up of my database to get a working demonstration of the web application. To be able to order just register, with an email, password, username and address, whereas to be able to view the Admin functions just log in with email "admin@admin.com" and Key "password".
I therefore wish you bon app√©tit, I can be the tastiest and most colourful poke bowl you have ever tasted
